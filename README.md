# Food Recognition Image Classification Project

This project is aimed at building a machine learning model for image classification specifically designed to recognize different types of food items. The model is built using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, and trained on a dataset of food images.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Given an input image, the model can classify it into various categories of food items.
- **Interactive Interface**: The project includes a web interface where users can upload images and get real-time predictions from the trained model.
- **Easy to Use**: The interface is designed to be user-friendly, allowing even non-technical users to interact with the model effortlessly.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-recognition.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Place your trained model file (`food_recognition_model.h5`) in the root directory of the project.

4. Run the Flask application:

    ```
    python app.py
    ```

5. Access the interactive interface by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

6. Upload an image of a food item, and the model will provide a prediction of its category.
